# PnPExtensionExample
This is a sample TemplateProviderExtension for the OfficeDev PnP Provisioning Engine. A Full writeup of this solution can be found on my blog at [thechriskent.com](https://thechriskent.com/2016/09/22/creating-a-pnp-templateproviderextension/)

The actual extension MyExtension.CommentIt will add an XML Comment to the root node of the PnP Provisioning Template XML file.

A sample PowerShell script is also provided to show how to run this extension.
